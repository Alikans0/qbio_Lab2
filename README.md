# This is a Lab notebook repository for my Lab2 internship at IBMM

### Supervise by Nicolas Floquet and Maxime Louet, Ph.Ds.

My work consists of proposing a model of the binding of Growth Hormone-Releasing Peptide 6 (GHRP-6), a synthetic agonist of the ghrelin, to its receptor, Growth hormone secretagogue receptor(GHS-R), which is a G protein-coupled receptor.   
To do so, I will be using Coarse-Grained and all-Atom modeling, and Cryo-EM density map.   
A model was deposed in the PDB ([7F9Z][1]) but seems to be completely wrong and presents multiple errors, specially regarding the peptide.   

In this repository, I will document my 2 months internship work, as well as ideas, encountered issues, meetings summaries, and perspectives.  

You will find a notebook that helps you understand what I have done and serves as a support for my pipelines.

October 10th - December 15th.
