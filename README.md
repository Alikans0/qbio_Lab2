# This is a Lab notebook repository for my Lab2 internship at IBMM

### supervise by Nicolas Floquet and Maxime Louet, Ph.Ds.

My work consists of proposing a model of the binding of GHRP6 to its receptor (GHSR), using Coarse-Grained and all-Atom modeling, and Cryo-EM density map. 
A structure was deposed in the PDB ([7F9Z][1]) but seems to be completly wrong and presents multiple errors, specialy regarding the ligand.
