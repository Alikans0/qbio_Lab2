needed files to run the cg simulations

	-cg_simulation:
all 10Âµs and read every ns

-clusters_5frames: the first 5frames of each cluster of each new_simu concatenated in a trajectory  
-new_simux

	-bead_type:
use martinize with neutral ter (flag -nt) just to see what type of bead to change in the .gro file to remove the charge on N-ter
